{"name":"Datahist","tagline":"history of data / data in history","body":"history of data / data in history\r\n=================================\r\n\r\nWith the support of the Sloan Foundation, the workshop  “History of Data / Data in History” will take place at Columbia University in New York this April 17-18, 2015. The workshop will bring together two communities: 1) historians of science and technology dealing with Big Data and its many history predecessors, and 2) scholarsdrawing upon many of the techniques of text mining, social network analysis, and other analytical tools associated with Big Data. It will be one of the inaugural events of Columbia's new [Center for Science and Society](http://scienceandsociety.columbia.edu/).\r\n\r\nHistorians of data offer greater analytical purchase on the limitations and dangers of the collection and analysis of different forms of data. They likewise serve as a powerful correction to historical myopia about “big data” today. Data-focused computational historians work with techniques well-suited to the volume of historical records often common in the last two centuries and illuminating applied to traditional historical sources such as learned correspondence. This workshop aims to foster a greater critical literacy around data by drawing together these two sets of competencies that too rarely overlap. This workshop would critically examine the techniques for the study of historical evidence and the creation of histories of large-scale objects previously resistant to more traditional methods within the history of science by pushing the start of art of tools in computational history.  It also hopes to use the critical acuity central to the history of science and technology to help refine our computational tools; better to understand their limits; and to improve upon them. The goal is not simply mutual critique, but the sharpening of tools and methodologies, qualitative and quantitative.\r\n\r\nParticipants will contribute a pre-circulated paper anywhere from 15 to 50 pages; this paper ideally would be what you consider your most salient work, that you feel would benefit from an intense intellectual exchange.\r\n\r\nYounger scholars and scholars of areas and topics underrepresented in the history of science and in computational history are particularly urged to apply.\r\n\r\n###Confirmed participants\r\n\r\nMartha Poon\tInstitute for Data & Society\r\n\r\nPatrick McCray\tUCSB\r\n\r\nManfred\tLaublicher\tASU\r\n\r\nFrédéric Brechenmacher\tEcole polytechnique\r\n\r\nDavid\tSepkoski\tMPIWG\r\n\r\nEvan Hepler-Smith\tPrinceton\r\n\r\nHenry\tCowles\tYale\r\n\r\nJoanna Radin\tYale\r\n\r\nDennis Tenen\tColumbia\r\n\r\nArunabh\tGhosh\tHarvard\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
